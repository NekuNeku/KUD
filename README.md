#Rules

• Keep spamming/shitposting to ``#spam``

• English is the main language here so if you wish to talk in any other language try and keep it relevant to the ongoing discussion.

• Advertising is not tolerated both in the server and in direct messages.

• All rules apply to Direct Messages (DMs).


#Advice

• In order to gain access to the hidden channels go-to ``#bot-commands`` and look at the pinned message.

• If you happen to be a Self-Bot then you can contact **@Neku** about that and be given the Self-Bot role.

• By being a respectful member and following the rules you may eventually be given the Trusted role. this gives you access to ``#calm-chat`` and allows you change your nickname.

• You can talk to **@Venik** (the creators of our Main-bot Venik) about bot-releated stuff in ``#suggestions``.

• Suggest ideas to improve the server and the bots in ``#suggestions``.

• **@Neku's** website is <http://www.nekku.me/>
